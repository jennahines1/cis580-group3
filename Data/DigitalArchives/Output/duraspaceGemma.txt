High-Level Summary of Requirements:
The Duraspace system is designed to manage a digital asset repository, particularly focused on collections and objects within a library or archival context. The core needs revolve around providing robust metadata management, controlled access, provenance tracking, and support for long-term preservation. Users (Repository Managers, DAMS Managers, and end-users) need to be able to:
Manage Collections & Objects: Create, compose, and describe collections and individual objects, capturing detailed information about their origins, relationships, rights, and usage.
Control Access: Implement access restrictions based on user roles and permissions.
Preservation: Track changes, monitor file integrity (checksums), and manage rights to ensure long-term accessibility.
Reporting & Searching: Enable efficient searching and reporting across the repository based on various criteria.

Functional Requirements (What the System Must Do):
These requirements specify the actions the system must perform:
Metadata Management:
	Create, update, and delete metadata records for collections and objects.
	Capture title, date, language, creator, subject, description, rights status, geographic location, etc.
	Handle associated information (e.g., publication information, license details).
	Support external descriptions and versions.
Relationship Management:
	Define and manage relationships between collections and objects (e.g., part-of, related-to).
	Establish hierarchies of objects (components of an object).
Access Control:
	Implement user roles and permissions.
	Restrict access to collections and objects based on roles.
Checksum Management & Integrity Monitoring:
	Generate and track checksums for content files.
	Monitor changes to checksums.
	Alert users to potential integrity issues.
Event Tracking:
	Record events associated with collections, objects, and content files (e.g., creation, modification, deletion, copying).
	Capture details about the event, including the agent responsible and the outcome.
Reporting & Search:
	Enable searching based on various criteria (title, subject, date, etc.).
	Generate reports on collections, objects, and their associated metadata.
Workflow/Composition:
	Ability to combine multiple object components into a single object.
	Manage the relationships between components and the object they comprise.

Non-Functional Requirements (How the System Should Be):
These requirements describe the qualities of the system:
Performance: The system should respond quickly to user requests (e.g., search queries, metadata updates).
Scalability: The system should be able to handle a growing number of collections, objects, and users.
Reliability: The system should be dependable and stable, minimizing downtime.
Security: The system should protect the integrity and confidentiality of the digital assets it manages.
Usability: The system should be easy to use and intuitive for all user roles.
Maintainability: The system should be designed for easy maintenance and updates.
Interoperability: The system should be able to exchange data with other systems.
