High-Level Summary:
The document outlines requirements for a system focused on managing archival collections, resources, and related metadata. The system needs robust import/export capabilities, user management with different roles, data migration support, and a user-friendly interface for archivists and other users. Key areas of focus are data integrity, access control, and workflow support.

Functional Requirements (What the system does):
Import/Export EAD files, Accessions data in CSV, Resources from MARCXML records.
Manage metadata for Resources, Components, Agents, Subjects, Events, Instances, Containers.
Assign Levels of description to Resources and Resource Components.
Import Agent information from EAC-CPF records.
Support LDAP authentication, password reset, bulk updating enum values.
Develop a custom importer.
Create, update, and delete archival descriptions in a repository, as well as any records within it.
Manage Digital Objects.
Associate an Instance with a Resource and/or Resource Component.
Assign Location information to a Container.

Specify the Source for a Name Form of an Agent and add new Sources and edit existing Sources.
Manage user roles, permissions, account creation, help center URL and topic mappings, additional properties for repositories, administrative data about archival descriptions and finding aid-related data.

Non-Functional Requirements (How well the system does it):
Usability: User-friendly interface for all users.
Performance: Responsive and handle large data sets efficiently.
Reliability: Stable and available, with backup mechanism for demo database.
Data Integrity: Prevent accidental overwriting of changes (versioning, locking mechanisms).
Security: LDAP authentication, Role-Based Access Control.
Maintainability: Design that allows easy updates and modifications (customizable configurations).
Scalability: Handles system growth.
