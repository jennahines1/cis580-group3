It appears you've listed several requests related to digital asset management, specifically within the context of a digital repository or institutional repository (IR). Here are some of the requests you mentioned:

Create custom metadata fields: This would allow for better search capabilities and a more detailed description of items in the IR.
Share files with different access levels: This is useful when sharing sensitive information among users.
Upload large files while allowing downloading: This can be important for meeting funder requirements and ensuring long-term preservation of digital assets.
Search for related reports/datasets (e.g., "see also"): This would help users find other relevant materials within the IR.
Request email notification when new versions are available: Users can subscribe to notifications for updates on specific items.
Download release calendar: A release calendar can help users keep track of upcoming reports/datasets.
Quickly correct errors in metadata or documents: This ensures that the IR maintains accurate and up-to-date information.
Set up or delete administrator accounts with various permission levels: This allows for easy management of IR administrators.
Create a personal account to request email notification when new versions are available.
Download report/dataset release calendar to load into own calendar: Users can track upcoming releases more effectively.
Harvest useful metadata from the repository via OAI (Open Archives Initiative): This allows other repositories or systems to easily integrate and use Cornell's publications.
Quickly resolve tech support issues: To ensure smooth operation of the IR.
Upload, manage, and share data sets associated with research projects: This can be helpful for researchers in sharing their data in a controlled manner.
Receive periodic reminders, including when something needs attention (e.g., next ingestion/approval steps), or something that might need to move from a current knowledge collection to Historical.
Promote/share work through interactive maps: This can help visualize the scope and impact of research projects.
Create a personal account to request email notification when new versions are available.
Download report/dataset release calendar to load into own calendar.
Preserve both content and metadata within the repository in a robust manner: Ensuring long-term accessibility and stability of digital assets.
Trace the list of revisors to determine who uploaded an item to the repository: This can help with accountability and transparency.
Pass ownership/management of assets to a successor: To ensure continuity in the management of the IR.
These requests highlight various aspects of digital asset management, such as metadata customization, access control, error correction, notification services, data sharing, and long-term preservation. They also emphasize the importance of user experience, system integration, and efficient administration within an institutional repository or similar digital archiving environment.
