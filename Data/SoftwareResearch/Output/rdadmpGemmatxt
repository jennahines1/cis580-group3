Okay, here’s a high-level summary of the requirements from the “rdadmp.txt” document, broken down into functional and non-functional categories, along with key themes and considerations.

Overall Theme: The document emphasizes a robust and well-documented Data Management Plan (DMP) process, focused on ensuring data quality, accessibility, sustainability, compliance, and facilitating reuse. The goal is to create a plan that’s not just a formality, but a practical guide for managing research data throughout its lifecycle.

I. Functional Requirements (What the DMP needs to do)

Data Format Support: Extensive support for a variety of data formats (Excel, JSON, Google Sheets, Fiscal Data Package descriptor files). This is a core technical requirement.
Customization & Branding: Allows for customizable branding and color schemes.
Dimensions & Measures: Supports user-defined dimensions and measures, offering flexibility for analysis.
Data Searching & Filtering: Provides tools for searching and filtering datasets.
API Integration (HASC Codes): Supports flexible API usage utilizing HASC codes (likely for linking to data sources).
Embedded Viewer Styling: Allows users to change the styling of embedded Viewer components.
Viewer Data Type Translation: Translates data type hierarchies within the Viewer while in embed mode – crucial for user convenience.
Metadata Import: Allows importing metadata captured using external tools, reducing duplication of effort.
Costing & Resource Tracking: Provides sections for documenting costs and resources used.
Data Sharing & Licensing: Includes sections to record intent to share data with licenses.
Reference Linking: Enables linking research publications to DMP records within institutional repositories (CRIS and repositories).
II. Non-Functional Requirements (How the DMP should be)

Data Consistency & Reliability: A primary focus – the DMP must ensure accurate and trustworthy data.
Flexibility & Adaptability: Supports user-defined elements and custom styling.
Usability & Convenience: Features like Viewer styling and data type translation enhance the user experience.
Documentation & Traceability: The DMP itself needs to be well-documented to ensure it can be understood and maintained.
Compliance: The DMP is designed to ensure compliance with ethical standards, legal requirements, and funder mandates.
Sustainability: The DMP should facilitate the long-term preservation and re-use of data.
III. Key Considerations & Stakeholder Needs (Derived from the Detailed Requirements)

Here’s a breakdown of key requirements, grouped by the stakeholder who requested them:

Researcher: Central to the plan - needs to pre-populate information, manage licensing, link publications, track costs, and record data requirements.
Data Manager: Responsible for overall data quality, governance, format support, documentation, and ensuring compliance.
PI (Principal Investigator): Ultimately responsible for the DMP, defining data needs, and ensuring compliance.
Repository Owner/Operator: Needs information about data volume, format, and security to assess storage needs and archiving capabilities.
IT Manager/Staff: Concerned with technical requirements (format support, API integration, security), storage capacity, and infrastructure.
Legal Officer: Requires information related to data sensitivity, privacy, and licensing.
Ethics Manager: Concerned with data sensitivity and ensuring ethical data handling.
Funders: Need to see data costs, compliance information, and the project's adherence to their rules.
Archive Manager: Focuses on long-term preservation, metadata standards, and legal status.
Research Evaluation Manager: Requires data information for citation counts and measuring impact.
Faculty/Data Stewards: Need information about costs, roles, and responsibilities.
Important Note: The document highlights the importance of a dynamic and adaptive DMP. It's not just a static document; it should be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
