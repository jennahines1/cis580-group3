**High-Level Summary:**  
The "g13-planningpoker.txt" document outlines requirements for a web application focused on planning poker, a collaborative estimation technique used in agile software development. The system is designed to facilitate team estimation of user stories through a structured, interactive process. Key features include game creation and management, participant interaction, real-time estimate tracking, and data export. The application supports moderators (team leads) in organizing sessions, estimators (team members) in providing estimates, and participants (observers) in reviewing results. It also includes developer and user-centric requirements for accessibility, performance, and compliance with web standards. The system emphasizes flexibility, transparency, and usability to ensure effective collaboration and data analysis.

### **Functional Requirements**  
**Moderator Features:**  
1. Create and manage games (name, description, invite estimators).  
2. Add/edit/delete items for estimation.  
3. Track and display estimates in real-time.  
4. Accept estimates (average, consensus, or specific values).  
5. Re-estimate previously estimated items.  
6. Import/export game transcripts (HTML/CSV).  
7. Delete games or accounts.  
8. Manage user accounts (login, password reset, timezone settings).  
9. Select estimation scales (Fibonacci or powers of 2).  
10. Invite up to 15 estimators.  

**Estimator/Participant Features:**  
1. Join games via URLs.  
2. View items and estimates.  
3. Submit and update estimates dynamically.  
4. See prior estimates of other participants.  
5. Use a two-minute timer for discussion.  
6. Scroll through historical data from prior rounds.  
7. View cards in a consistent order across rounds.  
8. Display participant thumbnails for personalization.  

**Developer/Technical Features:**  
1. Ensure XHTML/CSS compliance for accessibility.  
2. Support legacy browsers (IE6/7, Firefox 1.5/2, Safari 2).  
3. Implement database indexing for performance.  
4. Provide error pages and predictable URLs.  

**Researcher/Mike Features:**  
1. Store anonymized data for analysis (e.g., estimate convergence).  
2. Track usage metrics (e.g., adoption rates).

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
1. **Scalability:** Handle large user bases and diverse media types.  
2. **Reliability:** Ensure stable performance for critical tasks (e.g., estimate tracking).  
3. **Usability:** Intuitive interfaces for users and admins.  
4. **Security:** Protect against unauthorized access and enforce content filtering.  
5. **Performance:** Efficient processing of real-time interactions and data.  
6. **Accessibility:** Comply with W3C guidelines for users with disabilities.
